# md-img-paste.vim
Yet simple tool to paste images into markdown files

## Use Case
You are editing a markdown file and have an image on the clipboard and want to paste it into the document as the text `![](img/image1.png)`. Instead of first copying it to that directory, you want to do it with a single `<leader>p` key press in Vim. So it hooks `<leader>p`, checks if you are editing a Markdown file, saves the image from the clipboard to the location  `img/image1.png`, and inserts `![](img/image1.png)` into the file.

By default, the location of the saved file (`img/image1.png`) and the in-text reference (`![](img/image1.png`) are identical. You can change this behavior by specyfing an absolute path to save the file (`let g:mdip_imgdir_absolute = /absolute/path/to/imgdir` on linux) and a different path for in-text references (`let g:mdip_imdir_intext = /relative/path/to/imgdir` on linux).

## Installation

Using Vundle
```
Plugin 'ferrine/md-img-paste.vim'
```

## Usage
Add to .vimrc
```
autocmd FileType markdown nnoremap <buffer> <leader>i :call mdip#MarkdownClipboardImage()<cr>
""Default name of markdown's alternative name of images.
" let g:mdip_imgname = 'image'
""Image dir path relative to expand('%:p:h'). And this will be expanded.
let g:mdip_imgdir = '%:p:t:r'
""Use prefix/postfix, for example: <filename>.asserts like typora.
let g:mdip_imgdir_prefix = ''
let g:mdip_imgdir_postfix = '.asserts'
```

### For linux user
This plugin gets clipboard content by running the `xclip` command.

install `xclip` first.
